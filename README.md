- Then to run the program run $ python main.py

## Testing
- Test cases are included in the file tests.py to test all of the functions in this application 
- In order to run the test use $ python test.py -v

## Computational runs 
- There is a file included to aid in computing the asymptotic runtime of this application
- To run this file use $ python graph_avg_run.py 
- You will be prompted how many inputs you would like to run
- The program will run 10 times using the given input and calculate the average computations
- I suggest keeping the inputs small as it may take a while
