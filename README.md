 Give an efficient algorithm that takes strings s, x, and y and decides if s is an interweaving of
x and y

----

## Installation
- Start by cloning the project 
- In a directory of you choice run $ git clone https://github.com/asfopoo/interweaving.git
- Then run $ cd interweaving
- Then to run the program run $ python main.py

## Testing
- Test cases are included in the file tests.py to test all of the functions in this application 
- In order to run the test use $ python test.py -v

## Computational runs 
- There is a file included to aid in computing the asymptotic runtime of this application
- To run this file use $ python graph_avg_run.py
- The program will run with input sizes of 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,512,  1024,  2048  and  4096.  It will return the number of comparisons for each input.
